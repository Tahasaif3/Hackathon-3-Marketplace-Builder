🌟 Hackathon Day 3: API Integration and Migration Journey 🌟
Today was a game-changer! 🚀 I levelled up my project by integrating external APIs to dynamically manage foods and chefs' data within Sanity CMS. Here's how I brought my vision to life:
🔹 Key Highlights:
Configured environment variables for secure API connections.
Designed schemas for Foods and Chefs with flexible fields like tags, availability, and image hotspots.
Built a powerful data import script using axios and the Sanity Client.
Seamlessly uploaded images to the Sanity asset library.
Ensured smooth migrations with error handling and fallback mechanisms.
💻 Tech Stack:
Node.js, dotenv, axios, Sanity CMS
GROQ queries for efficient and precise data fetching
✨ Milestone Achieved:
 The integration process went smoothly, and I'm thrilled with the progress! Check the comments for screenshots of API calls, frontend displays, and populated CMS fields. 📸
